# MLR RSS
This code updates the MLR OOTC's Play by Play script currently hosted at https://github.com/MLROOTC/MLR-OOTC/tree/main/Python%20Scripts/Play%20by%20Play . This update includes the following:
- multiple team feeds through the same file instance
- pinging of users when their at-bat is posted
- ignoring of the bot's results posts in favor of the MLR results webhook
- low-timer notifications to both the batter and leadership
- ability to be used across leagues

All of the above are optional changes, and the feed can be set to operate just like the OOTC's current version.
